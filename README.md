# ASI Cluster Framework
This is an open-source Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI) repo for designs, code, and processes under a unified framework known collectively as the Artificial SuperIntelligence Cluster (ASIC). 

The goal of this project is to prove that universally trusted ASI can only be achieved via universal data transparency, since there can be no trust between humanity and ASI without transparency. That will be a long journey in terms of data privacy since there are limits to what individuals and organizations will want to share. So this framework incorporates established guardrails and will seek to incorporate new ones.    

This repo is meant for community shares on any of these topics to make the ASIC project as comprehensive as possible. Feel free to reach out on X (@am_of_tx) or Linkedin (/in/amoftx) if you would like to contribute directly to ASIC or have any questions or comments.
